# NiceSpot
Nice spot is an iOS application aiming at promoting the tourist places of the Guadeloupe region.  
All the proposed tourist places are natural and free access sites.
Each tourist spot will be displayed with as much information as possible to help the user get there.  
These places, having the propensity to change over time due to erosion or the vagaries of the weather, it will be possible for users to leave a comment describing their state. Thus, each user will be able to share a comment with all the users of the application.
A location can only be commented on once per user, and any location already commented on can be modified.

The application is composed of three tabs allowing you to consult  its content.  
The first tab, called "Spot", displays tourist spots arranged by category. The user will be able to see a list of all the beaches or waterfalls listed by the application.
The second tab, "Saved", will list all the favourite places that the user has chosen to save. Indeed, a bookmark system will save the spots that the user has liked.
Finally, the "Search" tab will help the user to find "spots" if they only have part of their name.

As writing spots is a long and tedious task, the user will be able to refresh the list of spots to download new ones.

This application implements UIkit. [The SwiftUI version can be found here][1]
